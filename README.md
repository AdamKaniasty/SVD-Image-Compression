# SVD-Image-Compression
## Overview
The SVD-Image-Compression project aims to explore the practical applications of linear algebra, focusing on image processing using [Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition). The primary goal is to reduce the amount of data necessary to reconstruct an image with minimal loss of quality.

## Results
We applied SVD compression to several images, each time varying the **k** parameter. The **k** parameter represents the percentage of singular values retained, where a **smaller** k results in **more information loss** from the original image. The results, including the space saved as a percentage of the original matrix size, can be found in the `images/` folder.

## Conclusions
- SVD compression is most effective on larger images when the k parameter is set to values less than 0.2.
- For RGB images, noticeable noise can appear even with higher k values.
